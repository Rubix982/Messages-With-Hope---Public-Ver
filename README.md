## Get Started

Take the following setup instructions to run the project as per below,

1. Use either `yarn` or `npm install` to install the `node_modules` and wait for the dependencies to install first
2. Run `node app.js` in the root directory to start the server locally

That's it!

To test and run if everything is working fine, head into the `scripts` folder and try running the `.sh` files in there. If proper response is received without any error messages, everything is working fine.

Currently, only two scripts are available.

For more infomration on Facebook Messanger endpoints, take a look at [Facebook Messenger - Send API Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/send-api/).

The OAuth key for `wit.ai` is the script itself for testing purposes.

Remember to run `chmod +x filename.sh` first before executing it.

Run the app.local.js for locally testing if everything is working fine.

### Saif Current Tasks

- Train the bot more to recognize better sentences ( more data, more examples )
- Change the response a bit
- Complete the response flow by adding new features
